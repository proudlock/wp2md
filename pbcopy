day itself finally came. A few days before, I'd discovered I needed a root canal, so timing was far from perfect.\n\nThe doctors dosed me up on pain killers and said it would have to wait until after the marathon. After months of training and managing to avoid any sort of running injury, it was just my luck to endure tooth ache and a lack of sleep before race day.\n\nBut what a day. When it came to my start time, I simply locked in my headphones and the only thing that went through my mind was 'Run Forest Run' - possibly something to do with the guy in front of me dressed as Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump...\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-23\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/op-marathon-medal.jpg\" alt=\"op-marathon-medal\" width=\"564\" height=\"846\" />\n\nAs soon as I started I knew that I was going to push myself beyond any sort of training I had done leading up to that day. All I wanted to do was beat 3 hrs, but when I reached the half way mark at 1hr 29mins, I thought there was chance of maintaining my pace and getting closer to three. In the end I managed 3hrs 4 minutes. I think this was all down to the amazing crowds that gather throughout the course and wanting to make the British Heart Foundation proud. It was such an honour to run alongside the other 85 heart runners and I hope to raise more money for them in the next few months. All in all it was one of those days that made me very proud to be British.\n\nPost-marathon, my body has really felt the pain. So I decided to take it very easy and try my hand at some Bikram yoga, to loosen up my muscles and stretch a bit.\n\n<strong>This week's fitness class:</strong> Hot Bikram Yoga in London Bridge\n\n<strong>Instructor:</strong> Jo Horton\n\n<strong>What it involves:</strong> I hadn't done bikram for several years, but from what I could remember it was far from a walk in the park. An hour and a half of yoga in a warm room, similar to a sauna, with no escape. I went with my girlfriend Emma and it seems that we went at a peak time, as this particular class was packed out and found ourselves on mats extremely close to one another, which made the class a bit uncomfortable for me.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/mg2068cr2p.jpg\" alt=\"mg2068cr2p\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" />\n\n<strong>My verdict:</strong> But it the job. Although the class is intense what with the heat, it allows the muscles to become more relaxed and so I found myself a bit more flexible than usual. I was stretching beyond my normal capability and the poses felt a little easier. Remember to stay hydrated and bring a bottle of water to the studio - my girlfriend, who is a complete yoga fanatic, really struggled because she hadn't drunk enough water during the day.\n\n<strong>Where to try it:</strong> 1A Magdalen St, SE1 2EN; <a

wp-image-29\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ollie1rebel_0.jpg\" alt=\"ollie1rebel_0\" width=\"1368\" height=\"912\" />\n\nI have been a huge fan of the original 1 Rebel gym in St Mary Axe since I first experienced their <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/health/london-marathon-man-oliver-proudlock-reviews-reshape-at-londons-1rebel-gym-10106610.html\">Rebel Reshape class</a> back in January this year - a combination of high intensity cardio, on the super high tech running machines, combined with bench work.\n\nAs soon as I heard they were launching their second studio in Broadgate Circle, I couldn't wait to check it out. This site offers the Rebel Reshape, as well as their new boxing concept coined 'Rumble'. Like Reshape, this is a high intensity workout but revolves around boxing combinations and kicks. Each rebel is assigned their own bag and as with all things at 1 Rebel, the equipment is high end and nothing is spared when it comes to the space itself.\n\nI used to box when I was at Newcastle University and for me, boxing is one of the hardest sorts of training I have experienced that uses all parts of your body. You're concentrating so hard on creating power in your punch that sometimes you forget to breathe...\n\n<strong>This week’s fitness class:</strong> Rumble at 1Rebel\n\n<strong>What it involves:</strong> The session is made up of chunks of time - ususally 1 minute - or different actions like left jabs, which are broken up with press ups or sit ups and the like. There is no rest time. This is for me what training is about: high intensity strength and cardio, which leaves you feeling like you've given it your all - but simultaneously rejuvenated. Unfortunately I didn't get to experience the whole 45 minute class, but I can't wait to get back there and do a full session.\n\n<strong>My verdict:</strong> Unfortunately I didn't get to experience the whole 45 minute class, but I can't wait to get back there and do a full session. I found the Rumble class to be on a par with the excellent Reshape class. But 1 Rebel isn't just about working out, it is an experience. If you are into the whole active and healthy lifestyle, or want to become part of it, then this is the perfect place for you. Spacious changing rooms with oversized showers and spacious lockers, dedicated vanity areas and high end skincare products mean the post-workout is as much part of the experience. You can also get a post-grind refuel in the shape of a juice courtesy of Roots &amp; Bulbs.\n\n<strong>Where to try it:</strong> 1Rebel, Broadgate Circle, EC2M 2QS; <a href=\"http://1rebel.co.uk/\">1rebel.co.uk</a>"],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["27"],"wp:post_date":["2015-09-04 20:53:10"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2015-09-04 20:53:10"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["open"],"wp:post_name":["oliver-proudlock-reviews-rumble-at-1rebel-studio-in-broadgate-circle"],"wp:status":["publish"],"wp:post_parent":["0"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["post"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"category":[{"_":"Fitness","$":{"domain":"category","nicename":"fitness"}}],"wp:postmeta":[{"wp:meta_key":["_thumbnail_id"],"wp:meta_value":["29"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_rest_api_published"],"wp:meta_value":["1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_rest_api_client_id"],"wp:meta_value":["-1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_publicize_job_id"],"wp:meta_value":["3202253122"]}]},{"title":["ollie1rebel_0"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2015/09/04/oliver-proudlock-reviews-rumble-at-1rebel-studio-in-broadgate-circle/ollie1rebel_0/"],"pubDate":["Thu, 23 Mar 2017 21:52:49 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"http://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ollie1rebel_0.jpg","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":[""],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["29"],"wp:post_date":["2017-03-23 21:52:49"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2017-03-23 21:52:49"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["closed"],"wp:post_name":["ollie1rebel_0"],"wp:status":["inherit"],"wp:post_parent":["27"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["attachment"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"wp:attachment_url":["https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ollie1rebel_0.jpg"]},{"title":["Oliver Proudlock reviews Velocity Workout at Core Collective"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2015/10/10/oliver-proudlock-reviews-velocity-workout-at-core-collective/"],"pubDate":["Sat, 10 Oct 2015 21:29:12 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/?p=31","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":["<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-33\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ollie-proudlock-3.jpg\" alt=\"ollie-proudlock-3\" width=\"1368\" height=\"912\" />\n\nCore Collective is a spacious high tech gym near High Street Kensington and Holland Park with multi coloured lighting and lively, thumping music creating a upbeat atmosphere. They break down their workout classes into 4 categories – velocity, resistance, accelerate and power yoga.I tried out the velocity class led by Dom, one of the many experienced and professional trainers.\n\nArriving at 1pm the class only had 4 people therefore we were paired up for the session.\n\n<strong>This week's fitness class:</strong> Velocity at Core Collective\n\n<strong>What it involves:</strong> Lasting 45 minutes the velocity class is high intensity and high impact testing your stamina, endurance and guaranteed to get you working up a sweat. Based on the idea of athletic interval training each exercise lasts between 20-40 seconds with a 20 second rest period. After one exercise you would move on to another exercise until the end of the circuit. In my case I started off on the jumping blocks for 40 seconds, rest for 20 seconds and moved on to 40 seconds of boxing and so on for 7 sectors.\n\nAfter a gruelling, intense and sweaty workout session all I wanted to do was jump into the shower and refresh myself. The showers are high end and spacious and I felt rejuvenated afterwards. I then ventured upstairs to the CPRESS café to enjoy one of their nutritious protein shakes. It does a wide selection of cold press shakes that you can add protein to making it the perfect drink to replenish and revitalise your body after a full on workout. Those in a rush can pre-order your shake to be ready for the end of your session.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-38\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/core1.jpg\" alt=\"core1\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" />\n\n<strong>My verdict:</strong> If you’re looking for something that will break up your regular mundane gym workout then this class is perfect for working up a sweat and switching up your routine. I left feeling rejuvenated and reenergized. Plus the Core Collective is commitment free for those worried about being tied into a membership.\n\n<strong>Where to try it:</strong> 45 Phillimore Walk, W8 7RZ; <a href=\"http://core-collective.co.uk/\">core-collective.co.uk</a>"],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["31"],"wp:post_date":["2015-10-10 21:29:12"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2015-10-10 21:29:12"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["open"],"wp:post_name":["oliver-proudlock-reviews-velocity-workout-at-core-collective"],"wp:status":["private"],"wp:post_parent":["0"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["post"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"category":[{"_":"Fitness","$":{"domain":"category","nicename":"fitness"}}],"wp:postmeta":[{"wp:meta_key":["_rest_api_published"],"wp:meta_value":["1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_rest_api_client_id"],"wp:meta_value":["-1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_thumbnail_id"],"wp:meta_value":["33"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_publicize_job_id"],"wp:meta_value":["3203168733"]}]},{"title":["ollie-proudlock-3"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2015/10/10/oliver-proudlock-reviews-velocity-workout-at-core-collective/ollie-proudlock-3/"],"pubDate":["Thu, 23 Mar 2017 22:27:41 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"http://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ollie-proudlock-3.jpg","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":[""],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["33"],"wp:post_date":["2017-03-23 22:27:41"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2017-03-23 22:27:41"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["closed"],"wp:post_name":["ollie-proudlock-3"],"wp:status":["inherit"],"wp:post_parent":["31"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["attachment"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"wp:attachment_url":["https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ollie-proudlock-3.jpg"]},{"title":["core1"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2015/10/10/oliver-proudlock-reviews-velocity-workout-at-core-collective/core1/"],"pubDate":["Thu, 23 Mar 2017 22:28:55 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"http://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/core1.jpg","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":[""],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["38"],"wp:post_date":["2017-03-23 22:28:55"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2017-03-23 22:28:55"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["closed"],"wp:post_name":["core1"],"wp:status":["inherit"],"wp:post_parent":["31"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["attachment"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"wp:attachment_url":["https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/core1.jpg"]},{"title":["Inside KOBOX: Oliver Proudlock reviews the high-intensity boxing class"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2016/12/07/inside-kobox-oliver-proudlock-reviews-the-high-intensity-boxing-class/"],"pubDate":["Wed, 07 Dec 2016 13:47:32 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/?p=41","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":["<a href=\"//players.brightcove.net/1348423965/r1xJxdDneb_default/index.html?videoId=5214104473001\">//players.brightcove.net/1348423965/r1xJxdDneb_default/index.html?videoId=5214104473001</a>\n\nWelcome to #PROUDFITNESS. I'm trying out some of London's hottest gyms to see why people can't get enough, speaking to the head trainers and experiencing their classes and giving you the low-down.\n\n<strong>Where:</strong>\n\nFor my second instalment of #PROUDFITNESS, I headed to Chelsea to try out KOBOX, a boutique boxing studio that offers high intensity classes in a bespoke studio setting.\n\n<strong>Which class?</strong>\n<div class=\"inline-block inline-block-related-single inline-block-right\"></div>\nIts class combines heavy bag boxing routines with functional strength training in a 'Fight Club meets nightclub' environment. Your bag combinations are projected onto the wall, so that you have a constant reference to the change in punch combos. Then in between the bag sessions,you are up against the wall doing squat jumps, push ups, throwing medicine balls at a target. It sounds exhausting, and it really is, but it’s all for a good cause and at the end of your session you feel re-energized, and ready to take on anything. People talk about the importance of releasing endorphins, and after one of these classes you'll know what they're talking about.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image atom-align-\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"op2.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/18/15/op2.jpg\" alt=\"op2.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<strong>Verdict: </strong>\n\nIf you want to break up your usual routine, get rid of stress and release those endorphins then this is the class for you. Just remember to breathe. I found I was concentrating so much on the punch combinations that I forgot to monitor my breathing, and this makes the class a lot more intense. The rest periods are short, and this leads to an overall more intense and more beneficial workout.  It really works the whole body, and I guarantee the next day you’ll feel it.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.koboxlondon.com/\">KOBOX</a>. 122 Kings Road, London, SW3 4TR"],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["41"],"wp:post_date":["2016-12-07 14:47:32"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2016-12-07 13:47:32"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["open"],"wp:post_name":["inside-kobox-oliver-proudlock-reviews-the-high-intensity-boxing-class"],"wp:status":["publish"],"wp:post_parent":["0"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["post"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"category":[{"_":"boxing","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"boxing"}},{"_":"Fitness","$":{"domain":"category","nicename":"fitness"}},{"_":"hiit","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"hiit"}},{"_":"kobox","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"kobox"}},{"_":"london","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"london"}},{"_":"made in chelsea","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"made-in-chelsea"}},{"_":"mens fitness","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"mens-fitness"}},{"_":"proudlock","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"proudlock"}}],"wp:postmeta":[{"wp:meta_key":["_rest_api_published"],"wp:meta_value":["1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_rest_api_client_id"],"wp:meta_value":["-1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_publicize_job_id"],"wp:meta_value":["5143806959"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_thumbnail_id"],"wp:meta_value":["45"]},{"wp:meta_key":["geo_latitude"],"wp:meta_value":["51.5073509"]},{"wp:meta_key":["geo_longitude"],"wp:meta_value":["-0.1277583"]}]},{"title":["op2"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2016/12/07/inside-kobox-oliver-proudlock-reviews-the-high-intensity-boxing-class/op2/"],"pubDate":["Wed, 17 May 2017 12:48:27 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"http://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/op2.jpg","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":[""],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["45"],"wp:post_date":["2017-05-17 13:48:27"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2017-05-17 12:48:27"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["closed"],"wp:post_name":["op2"],"wp:status":["inherit"],"wp:post_parent":["41"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["attachment"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"wp:attachment_url":["https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/op2.jpg"]},{"title":["Nepal: why a visit to this incredible country is a life-changing experience"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2016/01/29/nepal-why-a-visit-to-this-incredible-country-is-a-life-changing-experience/"],"pubDate":["Fri, 29 Jan 2016 17:00:04 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/?p=46","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":["<figure class=\"featured-media medium-width\"><img title=\"nepal1.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/article_small/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/29/10/nepal1.jpg\" alt=\"nepal1.jpg\" />\n<figcaption class=\"caption\">Inspiring: spending time with the children of Camp Hope</figcaption></figure>\n<div class=\"article-wrapper clearfix\">\n<div class=\"main-content-column\">\n<div id=\"gigya-share-btns-2_gig_containerParent\" class=\"text-wrapper\">\n\nI am lucky enough to have pursued my love for travelling and I have seen some amazing places all around the world. But I have never experienced anywhere like Nepal. When you think of the country, it's hard not to associate it with the horrific earthquake in 2015 that devastated the lives and homes of so many. However, my trip enlightened me to so much more.\n\nA close friend of mine who works for an adventure travel group called Tears For Tigers often raved about Nepal so when I told him I may be visiting to seek out a factory for my brand Serge DeNimes he decided to help plan the trip for my girlfriend Emma and me. The aims were to experience the history and culture of Nepal, visit a factory and see some of the charities set up since the earthquake.\n\nOn arrival at Kathmandu airport we were met by a man from our hotel who greeted us with so much warmth and kindness that immediately we felt welcome and so excited to start our trip. We told Tears for Tigers that we wanted to stay in comfortable accommodation right in the centre of the city so that we could experience everything at our doorstep. We did not expect anything as magical as Dwarika’s Hotel. Only five minutes from the airport, it really is bang in the centre of Kathmandu.\n\nWalking through the wooden doors is like stepping into an oasis, the most peaceful and magical place. As soon as you take in your surroundings you have an immediate sense of the history and culture of Nepal. The setting is like nothing I have seen before and the incredible architecture makes visitors feel as if they are travelling back in time. Within its walls it is almost like a little village that includes three restaurants providing Japanese, Nepalese and European cuisine, a spa, a gym, a pool, a library and a few boutiques with jewellery and traditional Nepalese gifts. The word comfortable doesn't even come close and as the rooms were sublime, spacious and had everything one could want from a hotel and more. I never wanted to leave.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"nepal27.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/29/10/nepal27.jpg\" alt=\"nepal27.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"423\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\nAlthough I could have spent my whole time there, I had to remind myself this was not the only purpose of the trip. Emma and I were lucky enough to be taken under the wing of one of the factory owners we were visiting who decided he wanted to show us around the city. It is quite overwhelming when you first walk out into the centre of Kathmandu and I highly recommend having some sort of guide when it comes to exploring. There is currently a fuel crisis as India have blocked the fuel and gas coming into the city and although the roads were clearer as a result, people are really feeling the impact and struggling to get from A to B. Taxi drivers have increased their rates too.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"nepal25.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/29/10/nepal25.jpg\" alt=\"nepal25.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"320\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\nNepal is a very spiritual place and has amazing links to the arts. One of the first places we visited was Patan, where the majority of the artists live. What remains of the former King’s Palace is here too and it was amazing to be able to walk around and see some of the sculptures and architecture. Since the earthquake a lot has been destroyed but planning and construction is underway for it to mirror its original state. The devastation isn't just within the palace walls. Everywhere you walk you can see the effects of the earthquake, with thousands of people without homes. However, the people here are so resilient and try not to let this situation phase them. They carry on, the roads and alleyways are filled with so much energy, creativity and colour. Kathmandu is very chaotic but everyone knows what is going on, so it is better defined as organised chaos.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"nepal14.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/29/10/nepal14.jpg\" alt=\"nepal14.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"423\" /></div>\n<div class=\"image\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\nSwayambhunath, also known as the Monkey Temple, is a bit of a drive from the centre but a must see. This is one of the highest points, with incredible views of the city, and as the name suggests there are a lot of monkeys. The view from the top was breathtaking. Although it was night time when we visited the lights and the noise from below was enough to take this unique city in from one view point.\n\nThe sites and the people are not where it ends, the food is amazing too. As we were having such long days out with visits to the factory and taking in the sites, we decided to spend our evenings at the hotel. The Japanese restaurant was very authentic, the food was excellent and the decor was so on point that you felt like you were travelling from Nepal to Japan through the sliding of doors. It is a credit to the Nepalese and their attention to detail. They want their creations to be done to the best of their ability and with the utmost authenticity.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"nepal28.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/29/10/nepal28.jpg\" alt=\"nepal28.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"423\" /></div>\n<div class=\"image\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe Nepalese restaurant was my favourite. This place is absolutely beautiful and is traditional to the Nepalese culture. Before entering you are asked to remove your shoes and wash your hands. Each table is beautifully made up and you sit on floor cushions. There is a choice of menus based on 7, 14 or 21 courses. We decided 7 were probably enough. Each dish was filled with so much flavour and you could tell so much thought and skill had gone into every detail. The evening was extremely enjoyable and was a real awakening for the taste buds.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"nepal2.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/29/10/nepal2.jpg\" alt=\"nepal2.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"423\" /></div>\n<div class=\"image\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\nOn our last morning before heading to the resort, which was 45 minutes up in mountains, we decided to try out the yoga at the hotel to get us into the Zen vibes before embracing the relaxed environment of the mountain life. It was the most active yoga I have ever done, even involving yogging and some very intense breathing exercises. Shortly after we were fortunate enough and completely honoured to be invited to Camp Hope by Sangita Shrestha Einhaus, the daughter of Mr Dwarika who founded Dwarika’s Hotel and who is now the driving force behind its success. This is a camp set up by the Dwarika's group giving shelter, food, clothes and a whole lot of love to orphans and families affected by the destructive 7.5 earthquake in April 2015.\n\nCamp Hope currently houses 331 displaced Nepalese from Sindhupalchowk, a region that lost almost 90 per cent of its homes. The camp has become home to many (mostly children) but also to elderly and a newborn who was nine days old the day we met her. 82 of the children at the camp have been enrolled in a nearby school and have school bags, books, supplies and a healthy appetite for learning. The camp is made up of a number of tents, specifically used for doing homework and school tasks as well as a few for sleeping, one for cooking, another for storing food, three outdoor toilets and two cold water showers.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"thali.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/28/18/thali.jpg\" alt=\"thali.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" /></div>\n<div class=\"image\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\nWhen we arrived we were warmly welcomed by all of the children. As they ran up to us, open arms; smiling, laughing and shouting we realised it wasn't going to be the negative atmosphere we had anticipated. In fact it was quite the opposite. They really are some of the most positive, happy and kind people we have ever had the honour to be around. Once we had said hello and Sangita gave all the children new fleece jumpers, we both felt five little hands touch us to give us a guided tour around their home. They told us in amazing detail how they spend their days; cooking, cleaning, singing and dancing. And to top off their confident personalities, they could speak fluent English after learning for just five months. We spent the morning singing and watching the girls' dance routines they had practiced. My girlfriend Emma is a model and all the girls were strutting around practicing their catwalks with her.\n\nIt was truly a magical and life-changing moment having these beautiful people offer an insight into their life. It was, for both of us, the most memorable part of our trip and it really hit home. It is something that is now very close to our hearts and it is a charity that we plan to work with over the years to come.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"nepal19.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/29/10/nepal19.jpg\" alt=\"nepal19.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"752\" /></div>\n<div class=\"image\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThis incredible visit to Camp Hope then lead onto our next two days in the mountains, 45 minutes from the centre, at Dwarika’s Resort. I thought the hotel in the city centre was special this was probably the most magical place I have ever been.\n\nWhen we arrived at the resort we were greeted with flowers and beads, given tea and a brief insight into the various areas of the resort, outlined by a map that also showed the various activities available throughout the day.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"nepal16.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/29/10/nepal16.jpg\" alt=\"nepal16.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"752\" /></div>\n<div class=\"image\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\nShortly after we were taken to our room, which was more like an apartment, had the most breathtaking views from the bed as well as our own terrace. The view was something you take a snapshot of in your memory and never forget.\n\nThe resort itself is vast and the map helps you navigate the outdoor infinity pool with incredible views of the mountain tops, the gym, the salt house, pottery, painting, cooking, yoga, two restaurants and relaxation areas. There is so much to do that you do not have a dull moment but you can of course do as little or as much as you want. As Emma and I were only there for two nights we decided to enjoy as many activities as possible.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"viewfromroom.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/28/18/viewfromroom.jpg\" alt=\"viewfromroom.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">Stunning views from the room's terrace</div>\n<div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\nMy favourite activity was the trek through the mountains to their farm, where they pick all the vegetables which are cooked back at the resort. It is about a two-hour round trip and a guide takes you through some of the most incredible views. At the end you get shown around the farm where we picked our favourite vegetables which we then bought back to the resort and were used for our dinner that night at the vegetarian Japanese restaurant. Dinner had never tasted so good.\n\nOne of the most amazing things about Dwarika’s Resort is the view of the mountain tops, including the infamous Everest. However, to see these clearly one needs a really blue sky and there are particular times of the year when this is most likely. November when we went is not usually that clear as winter is approaching and there is a bit of a mist which prevents you from seeing the whole line of mountain tops in the distance. However, on our last morning we woke up to a completely clear day and were so lucky to see a great view of the mountain tops. It was the perfect end to the perfect trip and I couldn't recommend a visit to this magical place more.\n\nIt is an amazing country, full of amazing people. Go visit Nepal and let the people change your life.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.experience-wildlife.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>experience-wildlife.com</em></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://dwarikas.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>dwarikas.com</em></a>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["46"],"wp:post_date":["2016-01-29 18:00:04"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2016-01-29 17:00:04"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["open"],"wp:post_name":["nepal-why-a-visit-to-this-incredible-country-is-a-life-changing-experience"],"wp:status":["publish"],"wp:post_parent":["0"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["post"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"category":[{"_":"camp hope","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"camp-hope"}},{"_":"made in chelsea","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"made-in-chelsea"}},{"_":"nepal","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"nepal"}},{"_":"proudlock","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"proudlock"}},{"_":"Travel","$":{"domain":"category","nicename":"travel"}}],"wp:postmeta":[{"wp:meta_key":["_rest_api_published"],"wp:meta_value":["1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_rest_api_client_id"],"wp:meta_value":["-1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_thumbnail_id"],"wp:meta_value":["52"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_publicize_job_id"],"wp:meta_value":["5149618139"]},{"wp:meta_key":["geo_latitude"],"wp:meta_value":["28.394857"]},{"wp:meta_key":["geo_longitude"],"wp:meta_value":["84.12400799999999"]}]},{"title":["IMG_6300"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2016/01/29/nepal-why-a-visit-to-this-incredible-country-is-a-life-changing-experience/img_6300/"],"pubDate":["Wed, 17 May 2017 15:59:20 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"http://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/img_6300.jpg","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":[""],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["51"],"wp:post_date":["2017-05-17 16:59:20"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2017-05-17 15:59:20"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["closed"],"wp:post_name":["img_6300"],"wp:status":["inherit"],"wp:post_parent":["46"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["attachment"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"wp:attachment_url":["https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/img_6300.jpg"]},{"title":["IMG_6300"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2016/01/29/nepal-why-a-visit-to-this-incredible-country-is-a-life-changing-experience/img_6300-2/"],"pubDate":["Wed, 17 May 2017 15:59:56 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"http://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/img_63001.jpg","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":[""],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["52"],"wp:post_date":["2017-05-17 16:59:56"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2017-05-17 15:59:56"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["closed"],"wp:post_name":["img_6300-2"],"wp:status":["inherit"],"wp:post_parent":["46"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["attachment"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"wp:attachment_url":["https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/img_63001.jpg"]},{"title":["10 reasons why you should visit Melbourne"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2016/03/31/10-reasons-why-you-should-visit-melbourne/"],"pubDate":["Thu, 31 Mar 2016 16:06:59 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/?p=53","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":["<header id=\"gigya-share-btns-1_gig_containerParent\">\n<h1 class=\"\">10 reasons why you should visit Melbourne</h1>\n<div class=\"intro\">\n\nThe brunch, the coffee and the arts scene just for starters..\n\n&nbsp;\n\n</div>\n</header>\n<div class=\"article-wrapper clearfix\">\n<div class=\"main-content-column\">\n<div id=\"gigya-share-btns-2_gig_containerParent\" class=\"text-wrapper\">\n\nIt's easy to see why Melbourne has been voted the world’s ‘most liveable’ city for its fifth consecutive year. I spent a week in the city and barely felt that I had scratched the surface. Melbourne, I’ll be back. Here are 10 good reasons to visit.\n<h2>1.The weather</h2>\nWhen Melbourne turns the heat on, it is hot. You can escape to cool off at the beach (about 20 minutes away) or find yourself a spot at one of the rooftop pools in town such as The Adelphi Hotel (<span class=\"skimlinks-unlinked\">adelphi.com.au</span>). The cooler weather Melbourne gets in winter compared to Sydney means your winter wardrobe gets a work-out and that investment coat or pair of boots will come in handy. Melbourne is a well-dressed city whatever the weather.\n<h2>2. Brunch</h2>\nMelbourne does lunch like a pro, which I learned from my well-fed morning spent at Industry Beans (<a href=\"http://industrybeans.com/\">industrybeans.com</a>). Situated in Fitzroy - think Shoreditch with better weather - there are few better ways to spend a Saturday morning, especially if you like your coffee. Also add Ginger Boy (<a href=\"http://gingerboy.com.au/\">gingerboy.com.au</a>) to your list with its delicious Asian Fusion cuisine and make sure you try their signature dish ‘Son in Law Eggs’ and their cocktail ‘Ginger Girl’ which has enough kick to fuel the rest of your night out. But it's not just brunch, Melbourne has to be one of the most innovative and exciting cities when it comes to food. It's a city where people love to eat out: great produce, imaginative chefs and a willing and hungry audience mean there is always a hot new spot to visit. Try Embla (<a href=\"http://embla.com.au/\">embla.com.au</a>), a new restaurant with a New York style vibe, offering a wide range of small dishes perfect for sharing.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"industry-beans.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/03/31/15/industry-beans.jpg\" alt=\"industry-beans.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"846\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">Brunch at Industry Beans in Melbourne</div>\n</div>\n<h2>3. The coffee scene</h2>\nStarbucks, be damned – this city takes its coffee seriously and whether you like your caffeine in a tall glass with ice or straight up and strong, you have come to the right place. Industry Beans once more takes this crown with their coffee roasted on site – it even has its own menu.\n<h2>4. Arts &amp; Culture</h2>\nThis is a city buzzing with dynamic and cutting-edge arts and culture. From the colourful, graffiti-lined laneways to the majestic National Gallery of Victoria (<span class=\"skimlinks-unlinked\">ngv.vic.gov.au</span>), there is always a show, exhibition or performance to go to. My trip timed with the critically acclaimed exhibition showcasing the talents of Andy Warhol and Ai Wei Wei at The National Gallery. I also caught ‘200 years of Australian Fashion’, with more than 120 works from over 90 designers, which is the first major retrospective of Australian Fashion to be undertaken in this country. Melbourne gets a big tick for creativity all round.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"mebourne-exhibiton.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/03/31/15/mebourne-exhibiton.jpg\" alt=\"mebourne-exhibiton.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">200 Years of Australian Fashion exhibition at National Gallery of Melbourne (Oliver Proudlock)</div>\n</div>\n<h2>5. Festivals</h2>\nNo matter what time of year, there is always a big event happening in Melbourne. While I was there the Fashion Festival and Food and Wine Festival were in full swing, and next up is the Comedy Festival and Formula 1. Racing is a big part of the culture - The Melbourne Cup in November is an amazing event to come to – not just for the racing but for the fabulous fashion too.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"vamff.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/03/31/16/vamff.jpg\" alt=\"vamff.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">(Oliver Proudlock)</div>\n</div>\n<h2>6. The racing</h2>\nHome to the infamous Melbourne Cup, Flemington Racecourse is reason enough to visit Melbourne - especially Super Saturday, part of its Autumn Racing Carnival. The grounds are immaculate with thousands of roses lining the mounting enclosure; there is a friendly vibe with families setting up camp track side and all the usual glamour (hats, fashion, champagne) associated with the races.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"melbourne3003i.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/03/31/14/melbourne3003i.jpg\" alt=\"melbourne3003i.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">(Vince Caligiuri/Getty Images)</div>\n</div>\n<h2>7. The fashion scene</h2>\nThe fashion scene in Melbourne is ever growing, with a wealth of up and coming designers to watch out for. Each is united by their passion to push the boundaries and promote sustainability and work within Melbourne. Design runs through the veins of this city and it is hard not to become inspired when amongst it. Look out for thought-provoking menswear from Vinvent Li and milliner Richard Nylon.\n<h2>8. Hidden bars</h2>\nMelbourne is designed on a grid system much like New York that makes finding your way around easy. Less easy - but much more fun - is to go in search of the hidden laneway bars and nightspots that the city is famous for. Local knowledge helps here and you could easily walk straight past them if you don’t know what you are looking for. Love whisky? Go hunt down Eau De Vie (<a href=\"http://eaudevie.com.au/melbourne/\">eaudevie.com.au</a>), a very cool bar on Malthouse Lane.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"melbourne3003k.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/03/31/14/melbourne3003k.jpg\" alt=\"melbourne3003k.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">Whisky den: Eau de Vie</div>\n</div>\n<h2>9. Shopping</h2>\nAll the creativity and design innovation filters from the high end to the high street. From Gucci and Prada to Zara and H&amp;M, Melbourne can give you a large dose of retail therapy – no prescription (just a fat wallet) required. If you get a chance visit local designer called Jack London, which deso great tailoring, with a contemporary twist.\n<h2>10. The people</h2>\nAustralians are renowned for their laid back approach to life - especially in Sydney. Melbourne is equally easy going, populated with people from a diverse range of cultures, with a real sense of community and a genuine passion for life and the city they live in.

So, at short notice I booked a long weekend in my favourite city in the world, New York.\n\nI fell in love with the place last summer when we were filming for Made In Chelsea there, and I knew it would be the perfect respite to 14-hours a week of running.\n\nWe booked some last minute flights and booked into my favourite hotel <strong>The Bowery</strong>, right opposite where myself and MIC co-star Stevie Johnson lived when we were filming.<span class=\"teads-ui-components-credits-colored\">\n</span>\n<div class=\"teads-inread sm-screen\"></div>\nI’m also due to go over there later this year to launch a new fashion social shopping website called <a href=\"https://shopa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shopa.com</a> so I thought I’d use this as a quick recce for that trip.\n\nService in America is usually outstanding but The Bowery was in a different league. We stayed in one of the Queen rooms with views over the city. Shortly after settling into our room, a member of staff bought us a bottle of red wine, and so it began.\n\nWe were only in New york for a few days, so I wanted to try and pack in as much as possible, especially as this was Emma’s first trip. On the first night we met up with my good friends Brendan Fallis and Hannah Broffman, starting the night in the hotel bar with my favourite cocktail, The Mexican Mule: Tequila, freshly squeezed lime juice, sugar syrup, and ginger beer. The bar at the Bowery is one of New York’s hot spots, an intimate romantic setting with a traditional Parisian look, yet strangely English vibe - it's  relaxed yet exclusive.\n\nWe moved on to a new restaurant in the <strong>Meatpacking District </strong>called <strong>La Santina</strong>, a glass box built next to the <strong>Standard Hotel</strong> with a young hip vibe, and an exquisite menu that they coin 'tropical Italian'. We described what we were feeling and within 20 minutes an array of amazing dishes and cocktails arrived that suited our mood perfectly. We followed up with a night cap back at the hotel before turning in as we wanted to make the most of our first day.\n\nThe next day started with <strong>breakfast at Gemma’s</strong>, a restaurant connected to the Bowery with the same Parisian vibe. Then we spent the day exploring the city, <strong>shopping on Fifth Avenue</strong>, and lunching in Central Park at the <strong>Boathouse restaurant</strong>. That evening we met up with a couple of friends of ours from the UK who were also visiting NYC. We went to a new Mexican restaurant on Ludlow Street and enjoyed 'mexican tapas' joined by a team of New Yorkers who were keen to show us the ropes. Shortly after dinner they did so by taking us to the new clubbing hotspot called <strong>Happy Ending</strong>.\n\nThe next morning, hungover yet excited, we went to my favourite breakfast spot on Bond Street <strong>'The Smile'</strong>. Again the service &amp; food was second to none and we felt ready to do some sightseeing before the big Mayweather vs Pacquaio fight night.\n\nThe weather was perfect, not too humid but still warm so we decided to <strong>walk the Highline</strong> checking out all the major landmarks including <strong>The Statue of Liberty</strong>. To treat ourselves, we spent the afternoon on <strong>The Standard rooftop</strong> with a bottle of looking over the New York skyline. In the evening we got into the American house party vibe and watched the fight sipping out of some red plastic cups\n\nI took Emma to <strong>The Waverley Inn</strong> on Sunday night, one of my favourite restaurants in New York - their truffle Mac and cheese is world famous. It’s such a romantic spot with an adorable outdoor garden covered in fairy lights. We enjoyed an amazing meal together with a beautiful bottle of red wine. It was the perfect way to end our last night in New York City together.\n\nOn our last day, it was a gloriously sunny so we decided to enjoy our last few hours by relaxing by the <strong>rooftop pool at Soho House</strong>.\n\nNow back to the grindstone - and the treadmill to burn off the thousands of calories ingested over the four days...\n\n<strong>DETAILS</strong>\n\nThe Bowery Hotel, 335 Bowery, New York, NY 10003, USA; <a href=\"http://www.theboweryhotel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">theboweryhotel.com</a>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["56"],"wp:post_date":["2015-05-15 17:13:34"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2015-05-15 16:13:34"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["open"],"wp:post_name":["oliver-proudlocks-weekend-in-new-york-the-bowery-hotel-and-la-santina"],"wp:status":["publish"],"wp:post_parent":["0"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["post"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"category":[{"_":"bowery hotel","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"bowery-hotel"}},{"_":"east village","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"east-village"}},{"_":"made in chelsea","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"made-in-chelsea"}},{"_":"new york","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"new-york"}},{"_":"proudlock","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"proudlock"}},{"_":"proudlockstyle","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"proudlockstyle"}},{"_":"Travel","$":{"domain":"category","nicename":"travel"}}],"wp:postmeta":[{"wp:meta_key":["_rest_api_published"],"wp:meta_value":["1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_rest_api_client_id"],"wp:meta_value":["-1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_thumbnail_id"],"wp:meta_value":["63"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_publicize_job_id"],"wp:meta_value":["5150033570"]},{"wp:meta_key":["geo_latitude"],"wp:meta_value":["40.7127837"]},{"wp:meta_key":["geo_longitude"],"wp:meta_value":["-74.0059413"]}]},{"title":["IMG_5938"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2015/05/15/oliver-proudlocks-weekend-in-new-york-the-bowery-hotel-and-la-santina/img_5938/"],"pubDate":["Wed, 17 May 2017 16:13:22 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"http://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/img_5938.jpg","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":[""],"excerpt:encoded":["Processed with VSCO with c1 preset"],"wp:post_id":["62"],"wp:post_date":["2017-05-17 17:13:22"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2017-05-17 16:13:22"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["closed"],"wp:post_name":["img_5938"],"wp:status":["inherit"],"wp:post_parent":["56"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["attachment"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"wp:attachment_url":["https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/img_5938.jpg"]},{"title":["Processed with VSCOcam with m3 preset"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2015/05/15/oliver-proudlocks-weekend-in-new-york-the-bowery-hotel-and-la-santina/processed-with-vscocam-with-m3-preset/"],"pubDate":["Wed, 17 May 2017 16:19:06 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"http://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/img_7324.jpg","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":[""],"excerpt:encoded":["Processed with VSCOcam with m3 preset"],"wp:post_id":["63"],"wp:post_date":["2017-05-17 17:19:06"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2017-05-17 16:19:06"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["closed"],"wp:post_name":["processed-with-vscocam-with-m3-preset"],"wp:status":["inherit"],"wp:post_parent":["56"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["attachment"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"wp:attachment_url":["https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/img_7324.jpg"]},{"title":["Jumeirah Dhevanafushi, Maldives -

The attention to detail throughout the resort is next to none, making the whole experience aesthetically pleasing but also extremely comfortable.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image atom-align-\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"jumeirah-dhevanafushi-azara.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/15/12/jumeirah-dhevanafushi-azara.jpg\" alt=\"jumeirah-dhevanafushi-azara.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" /></div>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nYou will find a host of facilities on this little patch of paradise.

We had fresh juice shots for breakfast, catch of the day for lunch and spicy curries at dinner.  Eating fresh fish every day never gets old - the local reef fish, a tender white fish, soon became my standard order. As well as the a la carte menu, Jumeirah Dhevanafuhsi hosts two or three themed nights a week, with either a barbecue or a local cuisine buffet all washed down with a great wine list and live local music. A great thing to do when you start to miss some holiday nightlife.\n<h2>Which room?</h2>\nAt Jumeirah Dhevanafushi, the rooms and surroundings are beyond anywhere else I have ever stayed before. The land villa, enormous in size, fully equipped with all mod-cons, and boasting its own swimming pool and beach, will be sure to tick all boxes. Offering a personal butler, in room catering, free movies and the biggest bath I’ve ever seen, whether you want to relax indoors in the living room, or dive into your swimming pool, this room will have you covered. And as if that’s not enough, the sea villa option has all that (and more) and balances you over the crystal clear water. Again, large in size and fully equipped the sea villa offers a Jacuzzi, infinity pool overlooking the vast ocean and wooden steps into the shallow waters from your very own floating paradise.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image atom-align-undefined\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"op2-maldives.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/16/16/op2-maldives.jpg\" alt=\"op2-maldives.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">The land villas come with enormous baths looking out to sea</div>\n<div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\n<h2>Best for?</h2>\nAnyone who wants to fully switch off, and treat themselves to a luxurious holiday that involves incredible service, food, weather, and the most beautiful settings then this is the place for you.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image atom-align-\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"jumeirah-dhevanafushi-aerial-view-of-the-resort.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/15/12/jumeirah-dhevanafushi-aerial-view-of-the-resort.jpg\" alt=\"jumeirah-dhevanafushi-aerial-view-of-the-resort.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Best time?</h2>\nWe went in August, which was nice but there was quite a bit of rain in between pockets of sunlight.

White walls, harsh strip lights and the aroma of stale sweat. Well, not with the new 1 Rebel gym in the city – this is more like working out in a high-end nightclub.\n\nSubdued lighting, stripped down and industrial Shoreditch-style interiors, exposed brick and copper piping - if it wasn’t for the rows of the latest high-tech treadmills, work-out benches, and indoor cycling machines I would have thought we had come to the wrong place - for a work-out anyway.\n\nBut 1Rebel is a new breed of gym and has thrown away the old rule book. Firstly there’s no contracts, so there’s no monthly direct debit bill. You can choose from just two types of classes – Rebel Ride or Rebel Reshape. Ride is on the bike, Reshape on the treadmill. Simple.\n\n<strong>This week’s fitness class:</strong> Reshape at 1Rebel\n\n<strong>Instructor:</strong> Dutch fitness coach Ida May\n\n<strong>What it involves: </strong>Rebel Reshape is a 45 minute class of extreme physical and mental intensity. The class starts with 10 minutes of running, building up your speed and introducing an incline - they've got Woodway 4front treadmills, which are like running on top of a tank track. Then it's straight onto the 1R workout bench for squats, raises, shoulder presses and abs. It's a simple combination of a bench, dumb bells - from 4kg to 12kg - and the hard-bodied Ida May giving not-so-gentle encouragement when needed. Oh, and it's all to a soundtrack of the latest dance beats.\n\n<strong>My verdict:</strong> I hadn't predicted quite how intense the class would be and had taken on a half marathon earlier that day. It was hard core - neither I nor my buddy for the class (and fellow Made in Chelsea cast member Alik Alfus) had any idea what we were getting ourselves into! After 45 minutes - I'd managed to keep up and even reached 18mph on the treadmill - we were completely exhausted, but glad we had done it. They have a Roots &amp; Bulbs cafe in the gym so we treated ourselves to healthy smoothies and snacks - all the food is gluten and sugar free too.\n\n<strong>Where to try it:</strong> 1Rebel, 63 St Mary Axe, EC3A 8LE; <a href=\"http://www.1rebel.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1rebel.co.uk</a>\n\n<strong>OLLIE'S FITNESS FOOD TIPS</strong>\n\n<strong>What: </strong>Forza LipoWhey protein in vanilla - it's extremely important to take in protein 30 minutes after an exercise session.\n\n<strong>Why: </strong>it contains a fat-free blend of plant strerols to actively lower cholesterol. I like to mix it with coconut water, but if you have the time make my miracle protein smoothie: 1 avocado, 1 banana, a handful of spinach, 1 scoop of Green Good Stuff and flaxseed, coconut water and 3 scoops for Forza LipoWhey.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["80"],"wp:post_date":["2017-05-25 16:35:27"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["0000-00-00 00:00:00"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["open"],"wp:post_name":[""],"wp:status":["draft"],"wp:post_parent":["0"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["post"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"category":[{"_":"Uncategorized","$":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized"}}],"wp:postmeta":[{"wp:meta_key":["geo_latitude"],"wp:meta_value":["51.5073509"]},{"wp:meta_key":["geo_longitude"],"wp:meta_value":["-0.1277583"]}]},{"title":["Inside Core Collective: Oliver Proudlock reviews its Velocity class"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2016/09/13/inside-core-collective-oliver-proudlock-reviews-its-velocity-class/"],"pubDate":["Tue, 13 Sep 2016 16:10:42 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/?p=84","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":["Welcome to the first instalment of #PROUDFITNESS.

It offers a number of different classes all of which you can attend on a pay-as-you-go basis Whether it be Weighted Yoga, Spin or their signature class Velocity, you will be sure to feel the burn in its stylish, contemporary environment.\n<h2>Which class?</h2>\nFor my first session, I thought it only right to opt for their signature class: Velocity. It's 45 minutes of high intensity circuit training that works the full body. Combining cardio exercises with weights, the class will have you using various workout apparatus from battle ropes, to TRX straps and a hideous thing called ‘The Prowler’. A large, weighted sleigh like object stacked with more weights and designed to be dragged across the floor by the unlucky trainee. That being said, it is an exercise combining cardio (the dragging) with weights and will be sure to give you a pretty nasty burn across most of your body. In a good way.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\">\n<div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\">\n<div class=\"image\"><img title=\"op-core-collective.jpg\" src=\"https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/09/13/17/op-core-collective.jpg\" alt=\"op-core-collective.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"376\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">Oliver on the TRX ropes</div>\n</div>\nDepending on your strengths you'll find certain exercises harder than others, but as with all classes; the harder you push yourself the better the results. I struggled most with ‘The Prowler’, as well as the hop press-ups - both of which will have you puffing and panting, and your heart rate going at a speedy pace. I felt the burn, but despite wanting to stop, the energy in the room really helps you push through the barrier and give your everything.\n<h2>Verdict:</h2>\n<div class=\"content\"></div>\nIf you're used to doing weight training in the gym, this is an amazing group class to break up your week with some high intensity cardio that is both rewarding and enjoyable. One thing to bear in mind: keep your pre-training meal light so you'll be light on your toes. I made the mistake of having a bowl of porridge, which made the session harder. I'd recommend having a protein shake or a banana before, then having a big nutritional feed afterwards.\n<div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-gallery\"></div>\n<h2>Facilities:</h2>\nThe facilities at Core Collective are second to none. The changing rooms are all very equipped with hair dryers, lotions and potions and have really clean showers. And as if that isn’t enough, the little cafe/restaurant upstairs is also great - healthy, nutritious and some the best looking food I’ve ever seen sits upstairs waiting for you to enjoy post-workout. From healthy sweet treats to brunch, lunch and delicious fresh juices, it has got everything covered and it's all made fresh daily by the in-house chefs. The perfect way to replenish your body after a hardcore workout.\n\n<em>Core Collective, 45 Phillimore Walk, Holland Park W8 7RZ; <a href=\"https://core-collective.co.uk/\">core-collective.co.uk</a></em>"],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["84"],"wp:post_date":["2016-09-13 17:10:42"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2016-09-13 16:10:42"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["open"],"wp:post_name":["inside-core-collective-oliver-proudlock-reviews-its-velocity-class"],"wp:status":["publish"],"wp:post_parent":["0"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["post"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"category":[{"_":"core collective","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"core-collective"}},{"_":"Fitness","$":{"domain":"category","nicename":"fitness"}},{"_":"london","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"london"}},{"_":"made in chelsea","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"made-in-chelsea"}},{"_":"proudlock","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"proudlock"}},{"_":"reebok","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"reebok"}},{"_":"velocity","$":{"domain":"post_tag","nicename":"velocity"}}],"wp:postmeta":[{"wp:meta_key":["_rest_api_published"],"wp:meta_value":["1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_rest_api_client_id"],"wp:meta_value":["-1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_thumbnail_id"],"wp:meta_value":["87"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_publicize_job_id"],"wp:meta_value":["5431056657"]}]},{"title":["op-core-collective"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2016/09/13/inside-core-collective-oliver-proudlock-reviews-its-velocity-class/op-core-collective/"],"pubDate":["Thu, 25 May 2017 16:16:39 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"http://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/op-core-collective.jpg","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":[""],"excerpt:encoded":[""],"wp:post_id":["87"],"wp:post_date":["2017-05-25 17:16:39"],"wp:post_date_gmt":["2017-05-25 16:16:39"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["closed"],"wp:post_name":["op-core-collective"],"wp:status":["inherit"],"wp:post_parent":["84"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":["attachment"],"wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"wp:attachment_url":["https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/op-core-collective.jpg"]},{"title":["Paris with Paco Rabanne"],"link":["https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/2017/07/13/paris-with-paco-rabanne/"],"pubDate":["Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:31:12 +0000"],"dc:creator":["sergedenimes"],"guid":[{"_":"https://oliverproudlock.wordpress.com/?p=105","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"description":[""],"content:encoded":["Last week, I had the pleasure of travelling to Paris for 24 hours to celebrate the global launch of Paco Rabannes new fragrance for men; PURE XS.\n\nPaco Rabanne, a globally known brand, have been leading within men’s fragrance since 2008 with the iconic ‘1 Million’. With sales rocketing above the rest, they recently released the hero fragrance Invictus, which too, has been a great success with it’s strong and powerful characteristics.\n\nLet's not forget the XS saga that started in 1993, claiming sexual desire free of any taboos. The advert, and the fragrance, is truly iconic and later led onto the rock star fantasy Black XS. Now in 2017 we see the release of Pure XS, tapping back into the foundations of what XS was originally about; sex and eroticism.\n\nBefore I delve further into the fragrance, let me set the scene for our 24 hour Parisian adventure.\n\nHaving arrived in Paris after a very pleasant, quick and easy journey on the Eurostar, we were driven to what can only be described as the perfect hotel epitomising the message behind Pure XS, The St James Paris. Now this hotel, being the only Chateau-hotel in Paris, embodies strong history combined with luxurious interiors that are most definitely unique. As you can see from the shots below, the interiors are lavish and excessive, dark and mysterious, historic and modern with an amazing outdoor space, and rooms which ooze that certain je ne sais quoi.\n<h5><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-110\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_4127.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4127\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" />Hot air balloon features outside</h5>\n<h5><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_4130.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4130\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" />Beautiful outside settings</h5>\n<h5><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-112\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_4133.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4133\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-113\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_4135.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4135\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" />Amazing lavish interiors in entrance room</h5>\n<h5><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-114\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_4137.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4137\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-115\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_4138.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4138\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" />Bed &amp; Bathroom in junior suite</h5>\nAfter a tour of the hotel, unpacking and settling into our rooms, it wasn't long before it was time to get ready and head to the venue for the launch of PURE XS. Within my lavish lair, my invite for the night ahead waits patiently setting the luxurious, and mysterious vibe for the night ahead.\n<h5><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-107\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_4151.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4151\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" />Invite along with gold snake broach</h5>\nWe arrived at the grand venue, The Automobile Club De France, and were taken to what seemed like a very opulent library. Within, there were areas involving role play, played out by female models, creating a setting that reflected the characteristics of the fragrance. In the centre of the room, a life size square box was pitch black and almost invisible. After a bit of mingling and interacting with the role play, the blackened box became a perspex glass room and revealed a lavish bathroom scene. Within the box, the male face of the fragrance, Francisco Henriques, was moving around the bathroom to classical music, reenacting the fragrance commercial live infront of us. It felt like we, on the outside, were watching him live the feelings of PURE XS through a two way mirror.\n<h5><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-116\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_4153.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4153\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" />Role play 1</h5>\n<h5><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_4157.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4157\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" />Role play 2</h5>\nOnce the lights went out, the commercial for the fragrance was played out, and the live bathroom scene we had just witnessed all made sense. The clip was sexual but with a tongue in cheek aspect, it was erotic but without being too serious and full on. It was amazing to see the advert come to life and feel in tune with it. (See below)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kPWwiXAg40M\n\nAfter our cinematic experience, it was onto the rooftop of the venue. Sipping on champagne in the summer heat, we enjoyed incredible 360 views of Paris. Including iconic buildings like the Eiffel Tower. 30 minutes or so went by mingling and chatting all things Paco Rabanne, we were led back downstairs to watch more creatives from the campaign, while getting a background of what PURE XS is about.\n<h5><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_4165.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4165\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" />Rooftop views - #excessiveme</h5>\n<h5><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_4315.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4315\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />UK gang from the night</h5>\nTo be honest PURE XS is pretty special. For me personally, I tend to go for scents that stand out, but at the same time are subtle and not too overpowering. For me, PURE XS does exactly that. It is vibrant, and magnetic; gentle and intense. At the top it is light and fresh, bringing memories of the summer, and as it settles it develops into sweet and warm tones with vanilla and leather hints giving a strong masculine touch. I would say with confidence, that this is a fragrance that would suit all styles, noses and seasons. Let's not forget the bottle in which the scent comes, that is pretty special too.\n\nEncased within a velour/velvet deep blue box with a large gold embossed logo, the touch itself sets up the lavish and excessive characteristics of PURE XS before you have even opened it. The bottle is a solid base of luxury glass, heavyweight in hand like a whisky tumbler. The glass is thick but sculptural, chiselled in the shape of a cut lighter. The bottle opens with a masculine snap and curved black lacquered cap and pure, sharp edges. The ombre blue glass plays with graduation, from the deepest to most electric blue. The bottle really is mesmerising, an extremely beautiful object that knows how to make itself desired. It is very clear that every detail has been thoroughly thought through, allowing you to feel immersed and lured into a world of PURE XS.\n\n<strong>NOW BACK TO THE PARTY.....</strong>\n\nAfter an incredibly lavish dinner fit for Kings and Queens, we returned to the bathroom scene room, which had been transformed into a party scene. The bath tub remained in the middle of the dance floor allowing party goers to take photos, while chucking very aptly coloured deep blue confetti into the air. The night ended on a high with all guests having a great time. It truly was a very special time I will always remember.\n<h5><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-120\" src=\"https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_4316.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4316\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" />Party vibes</h5>\n<h5>If you are intrigued and want to test out the fragrance, it is now exclusively available in all Boots stores around the UK.

laid back and light weight perfect for the warm summer evenings. I never thought i would be one to wear baggy trousers, however these light weight beige trousers from Double Rainbouu have 100% swayed me. They are so comfy, and work perfectly with a clean white tucked in t-shirt. Here i am wearing a really clean linen white tee from Zara, which is only £19.99. I have teamed the look up with some brown suede boots from Dr Martens, my favourite feature being the bright popping yellow laces. Then finally finished with some accessories, jewellery from my brand Serge DeNimes, some vintage sunglasses, and a camo fedora from Goorin Bros.\n\n[gallery ids=\"252,253,254,255,256\" columns=\"1\"
